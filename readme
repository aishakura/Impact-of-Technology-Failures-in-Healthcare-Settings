Abstract:

ElectronicPrescribing(e-Rx)has a significant potential to improve quality of care and reduce medication errors. 
However, its adoption rate in primary care has been slow for a variety of reasons.

This case study examines the adverse impact of an information technology (IT) failure on the prescribing process as a 
critical reliability barrier to adoption. 

Data from Allscripts TouchWorks database containing prescriptions written by six physicians in two primary care settings were 
analyzed using a statisti- cal change-point detection algorithm to identify the tipping point in actual usage and subsequent trends in usage behavior. 

Physicians overwhelmingly switched from electronic transmission of prescriptions to print option in the presence of such a failure. 

This case study uses an approach for a control system that will allow for early detection of system failures and rapid process improvement, 
and discuss implications for handling such failures in the rapidly evolving IT-enabled healthcare delivery context.
